# Basics

Hello, my name is Talan. I occasionally code things as a hobby. Also Floridian.

I'm a 17 year old Dual Enrolement student focussing mainly on Computer Science/IT.

# Why?

I just enjoy coding as a hobby.

The point of this website is for me to post things occasionally. It is a static website through Github Pages (with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework) so don't expect things too often.
