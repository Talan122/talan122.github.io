Hey, there aint much here yet but you gotta start somewhere.

This week I set up this website finally so it's not a hunk of garbage.

Before:

There is still much work to do but I'm happy with it.
Edit: I use OperaGX and didn't realize the background wasn't a dark color. I'll fix that in some time.

I'm initially building this website with the Hugo framework which you can find [here](https://gohugo.io) and the Ananke theme found [here](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke)

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Talan122/talan122.github.io)

I plan to have something to share at least once a month! Whether it's a Discord bot I'm coding, a rewrite to this website (which is bound to happen multiple times), or just what I did that month in general, I hope I can keep up with it.

The images all on the website by the way are just Discord CDN links to prevent taking space on Github. There's a limit, you know?

Some extra todos on the site:
- Cloudflare email redirecting
- Fix the landing page list so that it properly uses the description of these posts
- Add a contact forum through the website (apparently Ananke just straight up supports that?)
- Fix the footer not always covering the whole bottom of the page (check the Posts tab)

Short term goals:
- Finish the rewrite of my Discord bot, MerpBot ([Source](https://github.com/Talan122/MerpBot))
  - Much easier to take and use on your own!

Long term goals:
- No longer use Hugo and have a dynamic website. I can't host myself due to dynamic IPs and security reasons, and I don't feel like buying a bare metal box for that just yet.
  - Accounts
- Gitea/Forgejo set up and able to be used publicly
- Make a decent game

End of post. Have this cat.
